If you'd like to add your own custom styles:

Create a file called /assets/css/style.scss in your site
Add the following content to the top of the file, exactly as shown:
---

@import "{{ site.theme }}";
Add any custom CSS (or Sass, including imports) you'd like immediately after the @import line
Note: If you'd like to change the theme's Sass variables, you must set new values before the @import line in your stylesheet.
